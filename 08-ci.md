# The app is deployed via CI solution

## Description
Leveraging Continuous Integration (CI) for deploying the application ensures streamlined, efficient, and reliable deployment processes

- **Tool Selection**: Choose the suitable CI tool, such as GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
- **Build and Test Automation**: Automate the build process to compile the application and create deployable artefacts. Integrate automated tests to ensure that the code is stable and meets quality standards before deployment.
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up different deployment environments (e.g., staging, production) within the CI tool. Use environment variables and secrets management to securely handle sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and deployment keys.
- **Deployment Automation**: Automate the deployment process to push the application to the target environment. Use the Infrastructure-as-a-code solution. Ensure zero-downtime deployments and implement rollback strategies for handling failed deployments.
- **Notification and Monitoring**: Set up notifications to alert the team about the status of builds and deployments via emails or integrations with communication tools.
- **Documentation and Training**: Document the CI/CD pipeline configuration and deployment processes to ensure the team can maintain and troubleshoot the deployment system.
