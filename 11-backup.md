# The system has backups enabled

## The golden rule:

```
ℹ️ Your backup processes should be fast, shouldn’t affect the live system, and shouldn’t incur too high costs. Backup as often as possible.
```

## Description

Enabling and managing backups for the system is critical for data integrity, disaster recovery, and business continuity.

- **Automated Backup Scheduling**: Configure automated backups to occur at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) depending on the criticality of the data.
- **Backup Storage**: Store backups in secure, off-site locations to protect against local disasters. Utilise cloud storage services with redundancy and geographic distribution. Ensure that backup storage solutions comply with data retention policies and regulatory requirements.
- **Retention Policies**: Define and implement retention policies to keep backups for the required duration. Consider factors such as regulatory compliance, business needs, and storage costs. Implement policies to archive historical backups and delete outdated ones to manage storage efficiently.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt backups both at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data from unauthorised access. 
- **Testing Restorations**: Regularly test the restoration process to verify the integrity and usability of backups. Perform test restores to a separate environment to ensure that backup files are functional and that the restoration process works smoothly.
- **Versioning**: Enable versioning for backups to keep multiple copies at different points in time. This allows restoration from various moments to mitigate data corruption or accidental deletions.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring for backup processes to track their success or failure. Implement alerts to notify administrators of any issues or failures.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of backup procedures, configurations, and policies. This includes schedules, retention periods, encryption details, and restoration steps. Ensure that all team members are familiar with the backup policies and can perform backups and restorations if necessary.

## Proposed options

Utilise native cloud backup services like AWS Backup, Google Cloud Backup, or Azure Backup for seamless integration with your cloud resources.
