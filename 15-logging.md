# The app has a logging solution configured

## Description

A comprehensive logging solution is essential for monitoring application performance, debugging issues, and ensuring security.

- **Log Formatting and Structure**: Standardise log formats (e.g., JSON) to ensure consistency and ease of parsing. Structured logging enables better analysis and querying of log data. Include essential information in logs, such as timestamps, log levels, messages, request IDs, user IDs, and error stack traces.
- **Log Collection and Aggregation**: Utilise centralised log management systems to collect and aggregate logs from all application components and services.
- **Log Storage and Retention**: Store logs in a way that supports efficient querying and long-term retention, ensuring compliance with data retention policies and regulatory requirements. Implement log rotation and archiving strategies to manage storage costs and performance.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up real-time monitoring of log streams to detect anomalies, errors, and performance issues.
- **Security and Access Control**: Ensure that logs containing sensitive information are encrypted both in transit and at rest. Implement access controls to restrict access to logs to authorised staff only, maintaining logs' integrity and confidentiality.
- **Logging Levels and Policies**: Define logging policies to determine what types of events should be logged at various levels.
- **Documentation**: Document the logging architecture, configuration, policies, and procedures.
