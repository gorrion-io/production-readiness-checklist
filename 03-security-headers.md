# The check on https://securityheaders.com/ gives at least a “B” grade

## Description

Securing the website with appropriate HTTP security headers is critical for protecting against various attacks.

* **Testing**: Regularly test the site on [https://securityheaders.com/](https://securityheaders.com/) to verify the grade. Adjust configurations as necessary to maintain or improve the grade.
* **Documentation and Compliance**: Document these configurations and ensure they comply with industry best practices and organizational security policies.
* **Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring to promptly detect and address any changes that could impact the security headers and overall grade.

## Recommended values:

| Header                          | Value                                        | Recommendation                                            | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
