## Description

Creating a comprehensive risk management and disaster recovery (DR) plan is essential for minimising the impact of potential threats and ensuring business continuity.

- **Risk Identification**: Identify potential risks to the application, including technical failures, security breaches, natural disasters, and human errors.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each identified risk, prioritise risks based on their severity to focus on the most critical ones.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks, such as implementing security measures, redundancy, and regular maintenance procedures. 
- **Monitoring and Review**: Continuously monitor potential risks and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
- **Recovery Objectives**: Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for your application to determine acceptable downtime and data loss.
- **Backup and Restore Procedures**: Document detailed procedures for backing up and restoring critical data, including databases, application files, and configuration settings. Ensure that backups are performed regularly and stored securely off-site or in the cloud.
- **Failover and Continuity**: Develop procedures for failover and ensuring continuity of operations during disasters. This may involve using secondary data centres, cloud regions, or hot/cold standby setups.
- **Communication Plan**: Create a communication plan that outlines how to inform stakeholders, employees, and customers about the disaster and recovery efforts. Identify key contacts and channels for internal and external communications.
- **Testing and Drills**: Regularly test disaster recovery procedures through drills and simulations to ensure they are effective and that team members are prepared to execute them. Document the outcomes of tests and drills to identify areas for improvement.
- **Written Documentation**: Write down detailed risk management and disaster recovery plans, including all procedures, contacts, and strategies.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the written plans are stored in a location that is easily accessible to all relevant team members at any time, such as a shared drive, intranet, or cloud-based document management system. Provide access controls to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the plans, while ensuring that authorised staff can access them as needed.
- **Training and Awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions to ensure that all team members are familiar with the risk management and disaster recovery plans. Raise awareness about the importance of these plans and the roles and responsibilities of each team member during a disaster.
