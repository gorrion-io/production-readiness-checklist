# The app has an error-monitoring system configured

## Description

Implementing an error-monitoring system is crucial for proactively identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues in the application.

- **Tool Selection**: Choose a reliable error-monitoring system such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io).
- **Configuration**: Configure the error-monitoring system to capture relevant information, including: error messages and stack traces, user context (anonymised where necessary), environment (production, staging, development), release versions etc.
- **Notification Setup**: Set up notifications and alerts to inform the development team of new errors or issues.
- **Documentation**: Document the setup and configuration process for the error-monitoring system. Include guidelines for handling and resolving errors, and ensure all team members are familiar with these procedures.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights gained from error reports to continuously improve the applicationâ€™s stability and performance. Prioritise fixing high-impact and frequently occurring issues.
