# The frontend should be checked periodically in terms of performance

## Description

Regularly checking the frontend's performance is essential to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.

- **Performance Metrics**: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) to track.
- **Tools selection**: Utilise tools and services designed to measure and analyse frontend performance, such as Google Lighthouse.
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Set up real-time performance monitoring to track KPIs and alert the team to any significant performance regressions.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation on performance testing and monitoring processes, tools, and best practices.

## Proposed solution

Integrate [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/tree/main) in your CI/CD pipeline.
