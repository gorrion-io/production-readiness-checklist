# Data breach notice
## Description
Personal data breaches should be reported within 72 hours to the local authority. You should report what data has been lost, what the consequences are and what countermeasures you have taken. Unless the data leaked was encrypted, you should also report the breach to the people (data subject) whose data you lost.
