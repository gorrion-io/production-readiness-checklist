# Data breach notice
## Description
Personal data breaches should be reported within 72 hours to the local authority. You should report what data has been lost, what the consequences are and what countermeasures you have taken. Unless the data leaked was encrypted, you should also report the breach to the people (data subject) whose data you lost.

In the context of our applications, the team should inform the client about the obligation mentioned above. The team should also work on the incident reporting process that will keep the client informed about personal data breaches.
