# Consent granulation
## Description
Importance of Consent Granulation in GDPR Compliance
- **Enhanced Control:** Granular consent empowers individuals by giving them greater control over their personal data.
- **Transparency:** It promotes transparency by clearly communicating the specific purposes of data processing.
- **Legal Compliance:** Adhering to the principles of granular consent helps organisations comply with GDPR requirements, reducing the risk of legal penalties and enhancing trust with users.

We should distinct between consent to: 
1. Privacy Policy 
2. Terms of Service 
3. Email marketing 
4. Phone marketing
5. Sharing data with 3rd party services

This means that if the end-user agrees to any of the above, it should be a distinct agreement, i.e. in the form of a checkbox for each applicable consent.
