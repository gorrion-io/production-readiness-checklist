# Account removal by request
## Description

Ensuring that users can request the removal of their accounts and personal data is a key requirement of GDPR compliance.

- **Data removal or anonymisation**: All Personally Identifiable Information need to be removed or anonymised, including email address.
- **UI for removal request should be accessible**: Ensure the UI is WCAG-compliant.
- **Confirmation and Communication**: Inform users about the expected time frame for processing their account deletion request. Send a confirmation message or email to users once their account deletion request has been processed. Include details about what data has been deleted and offer contact information for further assistance if needed.
- **Logs**: Encrypt logs both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorised access. Restrict access to logs containing PII to authorised personnel only. Ensure that logs containing PII can be anonymised or removed.
