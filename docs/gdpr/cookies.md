# Cookie consent
Cookies, insofar as they are used to identify users, qualify as personal data and are therefore subject to the GDPR. Companies do have a right to process their users’ data as long as they receive consent.

To comply with the regulations governing cookies under the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive you must:

- Receive users’ consent before you use any cookies **except** strictly necessary cookies.
- Provide accurate and specific information about the data each cookie tracks and its purpose in plain language before consent is received.
- Document and store consent received from users.
- Allow users to access your service even if they refuse to allow the use of certain cookies
- Make it as easy for users to withdraw their consent as it was for them to give their consent in the first place.

There are some out-of-the-box options:
- cookiebot
- cookieyes
- tarteaucitron
