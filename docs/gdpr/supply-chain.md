# Secure supply chain
**Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
- Follow secure coding practices and integrate security into every phase of the software development lifecycle.
- Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies before integrating them into your systems.
**Regular Updates and Patch Management:**
- Ensure that all software dependencies are regularly updated and patched to address any security vulnerabilities.
- Establish a process for promptly applying security updates and patches to third-party components.

In the context of our applications, the minimum viable option is to regularly audit the dependencies, i.e. in the CI/CD pipeline.
