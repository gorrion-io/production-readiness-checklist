# Copy of data retrieval by request
## Description
This means that you should be able to [send their personal data](https://gdpr.eu/article-20-right-to-data-portability/) in a commonly readable format (e.g. a spreadsheet) either to them or to a third party they designate.

The export request should be accessible (e.g. a form) and processed without undue delay and, in any event, within one month of its receipt.
