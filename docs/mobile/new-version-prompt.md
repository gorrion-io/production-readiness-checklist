# The app has a new version prompt mechanism configured

## Description

Implementing a version prompt mechanism ensures that users are always informed about, and can easily update to the latest version of your mobile app, improving user experience, security, and performance.

- **Display the app version in the UI**: Include the current version of the app at least on one screen.
- **Tools selection**: Use the battle-tested tools to check for updates, like `expo-updates` or other packages.
- **Handling Mandatory Updates**: If the new version of the app brings breaking changes, ensure users cannot dismiss the update prompt and must update the app to continue using it.
- **Scheduled Checks**: Implement periodic checks for new versions, such as on app launch or at regular intervals.
