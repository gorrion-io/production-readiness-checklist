# The app payment system complies with regulations

## Description

Ensuring that the payment system in your mobile app complies with relevant regulations is crucial for legal compliance and user trust. It will also allow you to pass the store reviews.

* **Documentation**: Remember to document the decisions made and the thinking process. It may help with the App Store review process.

## In-App purchases vs other payment method

### When to Use In-App Purchases (IAP)

1. **Digital Goods and Services:**

	- Virtual currencies

	- In-game content

	- Premium features or functionality within the app

	- Consumable items

2. **Subscriptions to App Services:**

	- Premium content subscriptions

	- Access to additional content or features within the app

3. **Digital Media:**

	- Selling digital content consumed within the app, such as e-books, music, or video streaming subscriptions, with the [entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/support/apps-using-alternative-payment-providers-in-the-eu/) for music streaming services

### When to Use Other Payment Methods

1. **Physical Goods:**

	- Merchandise (e.g. clothing, electronics)

	- Groceries, food, and beverages

2. **Real-World Services:**

	- Ride-sharing services

	- Food delivery services

	- Booking appointments or reservations

3. **Person-to-Person Services:**

	- Real-time person-to-person services

	- Physical events tickets

4. **Subscription Services Accessed Outside the App:**

	- Subscriptions that provide access to content or services outside of the app.

	- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms for business use.

5. **Donations:**

	- Donations to non-profit organisations.

6. **Other:**

	- Hardware products or other physical items that require shipping.

	- Payments for professional services provided outside the app

### Key Considerations

- **Compliance**: Both platforms have strict guidelines, and non-compliance can lead to app rejection or removal.

- **Fees**: In-app purchases through Apple or Google generally incur a 15-30% fee, while other payment methods might involve different transaction fees.

- **User Experience**: Using in-app purchases provides a seamless experience within the app, while external payment methods might redirect users to a web view or an external site.
