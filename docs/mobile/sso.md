# The app using SSO always applies the recent rules

## Description

Ensuring that your app always applies the most recent rules for SSO (Single Sign-On), e.g. Sign-in with Apple or Google is crucial for maintaining security, compliance, and user access management.

Verify that the flows of signing-up and signing-in apply all the rules and that all necessary user info is gathered at the right time, e.g. Apple returns first and last name only during the first usage of SSO.
