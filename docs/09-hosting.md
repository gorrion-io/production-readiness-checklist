# The app is hosted on production-grade cloud solution

## Description

Hosting the application on a production-grade cloud solution ensures scalability, reliability, and security.

- **Scalability**: Implement auto-scaling to ensure the application can handle varying loads without performance degradation. Configure scaling policies based on metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and request count.
- **Security**: Enable DDoS protection and use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to safeguard against attacks. Ensure data encryption both at rest and in transit using cloud-native encryption services.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track application performance, detect anomalies, and diagnose issues.
- **Cost Management**: Monitor and manage cloud usage to optimize costs. Use tools and services provided by the cloud provider to track spending and identify opportunities for cost savings. Implement budgeting and alerting to control and manage cloud expenditures proactively.
- **Documentation and Compliance**: Document your cloud architecture, deployment processes, and security measures. Ensure that your cloud setup complies with relevant standards and regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA).
