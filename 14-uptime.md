# The app has an uptime-monitoring system configured

## Description

Implementing an uptime-monitoring system is crucial for ensuring that your application remains available and responsive.

- **Tool Selection**: Choose a reliable uptime-monitoring tool that fits your needs, e.g. Better Uptime or Pingdom. Ensure the chosen tool supports the monitoring of all necessary application components and services.
- **Configuration of Monitoring**: Configure the monitoring tool to check all critical endpoints of your application at regular intervals. et the check frequency based on your service level agreements (SLAs) and user expectations. Common intervals range from 1 to 5 minutes.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Ensure that the monitoring tool performs checks from multiple geographic locations to detect regional outages and provide a comprehensive view of uptime.
- **Alerting and Notifications**: Configure alerts to notify the appropriate team members when an endpoint becomes unavailable or when predefined thresholds (e.g., latency) are breached.
- **Escalation Policies**: Define escalation policies to ensure that critical issues are quickly escalated to higher-level support or management teams if not resolved promptly.
- **Incident Management**: Develop and document an incident response plan outlining steps to be taken when downtime or performance issues are detected.
- **Performance Monitoring**: In addition to basic uptime checks, configure the tool to monitor performance metrics such as response times, load times, and error rates to ensure that the application not only stays up but remains performant.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Set up dashboards within the monitoring tool to provide real-time visibility into the application's uptime and performance. Leverage historical data and reports to analyse trends, identify patterns, and improve system reliability over time.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the uptime monitoring configuration, including dashboard setups, alert policies, and incident response procedures.
- **Team Training**: Conduct regular training sessions to ensure all relevant team members understand how to use the monitoring tools and respond to alerts effectively.
