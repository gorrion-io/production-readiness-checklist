# All password related to the project should be shared via password manager only with corresponding group

## Description

Ensuring that all project-related passwords are managed and shared securely is crucial for protecting sensitive information and maintaining security best practices.

- **Password Management Policies**: Establish clear policies for creating, managing, and sharing passwords. Ensure that all team members are trained and adhere to these policies. Require the use of strong, unique passwords for each account and service related to the project. Leverage the password generator tool provided by the password manager to create strong passwords.
- **Access Auditing**: Enable and regularly review access logs and audit trails provided by the password manager to monitor who accesses or modifies passwords.
- **Incident Response**: Define and document procedures for responding to potential security incidents involving passwords, such as compromised accounts or leaked credentials. Ensure that team members know how to report security incidents and follow the incident response procedures.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation on password management policies, procedures, and best practices. Ensure this documentation is accessible to all team members.
