# There is a way to quickly check and deploy hot fixes to production

## Description

Having an efficient process for deploying hot fixes ensures that critical issues impacting production can be resolved swiftly and with minimal disruption.

- **Branching Strategy**: Maintain a `ï»¿hotfix` branch from which hot fixes are created. This branch should always be branched off from the current production branch.
- **Fast-Track Testing**: Ensure that critical tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) are part of the CI pipeline for hotfix branches to quickly validate changes.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Implement a dedicated CI/CD pipeline for hot fixes that automatically deploys to production upon passing tests and receiving approvals.
- **Notification and Monitoring**: Set up notifications to inform the team and stakeholders when a hot fix is being deployed and once the deployment is complete. Closely monitor the application after deploying a hot fix to ensure that the issue is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
- **Rollout and Rollback Strategies**: Ensure mechanisms are in place to monitor performance and user feedback during the incremental rollout. Implement a rollback plan to revert the hot fix quickly if issues arise during or after deployment. Test rollback procedures regularly to ensure they can be executed smoothly under pressure.
- **Documentation**: Document the hot fix process, including branching strategy, testing, approval workflows, deployment steps, and rollback procedures.
